# studentDatabaseApplication
Simple application to allow students to enroll on multiple courses and pay tuition.

Scenario: I am a database admin for a university. I need to create an application which manages student enrollments and tuition fees.

Application requirements:
- ask the user how many new students will be added.
- Promp the user to enter the name and year for every student created.
- Each student should have a 5-digit unique ID, the first number will be their grade level.
- A student can enroll in the following courses:
   - History, Math, English, Computing, Chemistry, Information Technology, Business Studies.
- Each course costs Â£600 to enroll.
- Allow the student to view their remaining balance and pay towards their tuition.
- To see the status of the student including their name, ID, courses they are enrolled on and the balance remaining of their tuition.
